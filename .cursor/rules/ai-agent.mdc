The AI agent must be able to fetch the necessary videos from youtube periodically(like 6hrs once something like that) based upon the user's viewing experience and feed it inside these genre subcategories i mentioned

All JSON outputs must be strictly valid (no comments or trailing commas).
Keep prompts in source-control so model changes can be tracked.
