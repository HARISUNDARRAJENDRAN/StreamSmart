This rule provides project context for implementing an AI agent that delivers genre-based personalized video recommendations.


## Purpose
Use this rule when working on:
- AI agent logic for real-time personalized recommendations.
- Integrating reinforcement learning-inspired feedback loops.
- Connecting genre-based APIs to frontend components.
- Modeling user preferences and dynamic content updates.

## Context
This project uses an AI agent to recommend videos by:
- Learning from explicit (likes, ratings) and implicit (watch time, hover) feedback.
- Maintaining per-genre dynamic user profiles.
- Using temporal decay and affinity scoring to update recommendations.
- Balancing exploitation of known preferences with exploration of fresh content.

Backend is Python-based for AI logic. Node.js is used for app logic. Data is stored in MongoDB Atlas and optionally cached in Redis.

## Technologies
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas)
- Node.js backend
- MongoDB, Redis
- React frontend
