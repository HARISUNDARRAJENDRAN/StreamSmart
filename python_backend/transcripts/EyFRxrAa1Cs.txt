All right, let's run it. Good luck, everyone. It's a pleasure competing. Let's go. I'm going to get Yes. All right, let's go. Imposter. Right, so I've got to dial in here. I'm not actually. I was just trying to get Lachlan to think I was. I was just having a bit of fun. Harry didn't mute his mic. Ah, we'll let him cook though. We'll let him cook. I'm in the tracker again. No time. Lord, dance to the time lord again. Ladies and gentlemen, there are three imposters today. However, none of them know who the other imposters are, meaning they can kill each other. Better give me that. I better see red. Better see red. I see blue. Oh, sucks. Honestly, bro, it's a brown. Have a round out mate. Apparently, this is Among Us, but the imposters don't know who the other imposters are. So, essentially, all the person knows is they an imposter, but anyone they kill could also be their imposter teammate. So, they just got to try and fend for themselves, I guess. All right, welcome back to another episode, Sidemen fans. I'm excited for this one. Ooh, impostor. This is an interesting one cuz I don't know who my teammates are. I could kill my own teammates. Oh no. Why am I imposter? So, do I try and work out who my imposter friends are? But they could also kill me, so I don't know. Ooh, I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I don't know who my imposter teammates are. Medic. Who should I protect? Who's likely to die first? If I'm imposter, Simon has to die. He's lucky. Oh, where's Simon? Where's Simon? All right, I'm going to shoot him. Should I really should protect JJ did you? But I'm going to protect Simon. Thanks. I could kill one of my imposter teammates. I think I've got to try and work out who they are and use that to my favor. it. He's gone somehow. Oh, great. Well done, Baz. Well done. Wait, what? What? Double. What just happened? JJ was sheriff and he just tried to kill me and he killed himself. Is that where it is, Simon? or it backfired on something else which Toby that's what I think it is it might be that but either way good you know what I agree with was anyone else there saw that or is Simon just I don't see Toby saw Toby saw Toby saw yeah I saw I don't know what happened to Vic by the way I don't know where he was yeah Vic I have no clue no one seems to care either that's a bit sad RIP's in the chat I guess Vic Vic from the grave bro you know I love you fine everyone else could be a hater all right I'll be hopping in the vents but I'm not Why would you say that Because it's a bit weird to say that. That is so played, bro. Like, come on. Hey, let's watch it. I did it once. You did a couple times. We've all been We've all done it. Come. Come. Let's do it. Yeah, I'll watch you. I'll come watch you. Go to the medic one. Go to the medic one. All right, Vic. What happened? Imagine Bazinga as an imposter. His first kill is another imposter. I was sat there saying, you know, I'm not going to kill anyone until I know whether they might be an imposttor or not. And then BZ just kills me. I'm like, great. If he kills Lannon as well, it'll be generational. Two imposters remain. Oh Well, we killed we killed a uh Oh I killed Vickstar, didn't I? Quick, go before the lights come back. I'm just going to hide. No, someone saw. They're all They all pulled up with the medic and I'm just going to be sitting here l dancing. Oh, come on, man. Yay! Again! Again! Again! Again! Again! Again! Again! Do I have time to see it again? Come out! Yeah! Again! Again! Again! Again! Yay! Oh my kill cool down is like 40 seconds, bro. That's insane work. Oh, I've been shielded. That's so generous. Someone thinks I'm not the killer. I'm just going to be a creepy little doors guy. Just lock every door. I'm just going to get on cams, man. Oh, suck it, man. Oh, it's so annoying. I hate blue. The the color blue pisses me off now. Genuinely. Oh, this reminds What's going on? I can't I can't move. Oh, for sake, man. Oh, time lords. The time lords are crazy. Oh, hey guys. Okie dokie. Huh? Oh, oxygen. And this is a tough lobby now. I've lost one of my teammates. Let me guess. Lannon's one of them. I actually need to go up there to be fair. No one's in there. No one's in there. Why is no one in there? I'm just going to solve it. 773 96. Why is no one in there? Why is no one doing it? Why is no one doing it? Oh my god. Going to win. him. Took a little bit long there. Oh. Oh my god. Wait, did he get revived? Cuz I heard the time thing go off. So, no. Is he He's alive by the way. Who's alive? Who's alive? Josh. No, he's not. No, the body was dead. The body's dead. No, but look, he has no X over him. No, he does. He does on my screen. Oh, the time lapse thing just happened. He's He's dead. Yeah, he is dead. Who just came into admin? Who did that? I just came into and then it was Lachlan afterwards. Yeah, Lachlan, why did you not go to the medic one? Because who Lan is my suspicion right now. Yeah, cuz that body wasn't there when I ran in Ethan. Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't. But also I would note that Bez was sitting on the timer trying to wait the last second and then as soon as Toby walked in that's when he like did the button. H interesting. I No, I was putting the code in. He did take a long time. If if Josh is dead seven again, man. Yeah. Can I bring up some like some It's kind of like meta info. I'm not sure if it's meant to be on. And there's three said something at certain points. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I saw that as well. So what it say? Wait, did you Oh, Toby just said there's three impos three imposters, but when when you when the round ends, it says two remaining. Yeah, cuz JJ killed himself or something. I don't know. Someone died. No, I'm telling you, in total, there's three imposters. So, that means Toby must be one of them cuz he said there's two. I You know what? That makes perfect sense. I don't mind that. Okay, shut up. Seven. I'm not voting on seven, dog. I'm not voting. Oh, Lachlan jumped on that quick, by the way. Lachlan was was Why did you not go lock the medic and all right me the medic I want to see you I want to see you vent holy I saved the game though the game it's funny though it is it is but now they won't sus me no sus in that kill at all on their screens cuz of lag I actually would have been so far behind Josh it's crazy l Wait I'm alive I'm alive wait what Josh's Alive. Just alive. I'm alive. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it. I've risen from the depths. I'm alive. I didn't go to the meeting, but I'm alive. Wait, how is he alive? The time rewinded after he Oh my god. No. So, these imposters need to cook now, bro. The kill cool down's killing me. 33 seconds on the kill timer. That's crazy. Fix it. Josh is so dead. I'm alive. I'm alive. Who killed you? Who killed? Oh my god. He's back. Who killed you? Who killed you? Who killed you? Who killed you? Who was it? Laser. I'm just going to say I was going to say shittest role ever. By the way, what the is that? Oh, I've just like I've just brought someone back from the dead who can say everything about who they time off to the right time at the right time. 30. Okay, make that time lord have like a 5minute countdown. That is Can we say who whoever's whoever's time lord has played an absolute blinder there? Hey, I appreciate you. Thank you, man. No, you know what? you. 100 seconds. You're all sitting here. It's late. is All garbage. You can come into my office. The bit's been done. The bit's been done. We know you can come in my office. this guy. Yeah, my my time lord play was sick. Thank you, man. Damn. Get cooked now. That that sucks. Hey. Hey, could be worse. You could have been killed first round by your imposter teammate. hell. Great round for the imposters right now. I honestly thought it was GG. I thought it was over, man. Yeah. Yeah, it was looking good. You had no susses until Dude, no suses. It was a great kill. Great kill. And then just broken. Oh. Oh, I came back to life, by the way. Ethan, come on. This game pisses me off. Well, I'm Um, 45 second kill cool down, bro. What's the point? What's the point? What's the point, lads? So, I'm guessing the time thing happened like at the exact right second, but obviously on my screen, I was dead in the meeting, so I didn't talk. Didn't know who. All right. Now, I got to show I'm never going to get a chance to show Simon I can get in the vent. I'm never going to get the chance. Like, look how long it's taking me just to do two tasks. Oh, for sake, bro. He's going to kill me. I'm trying to me. Come on. Here we go. You ready? I get it cuz he's the guy that can actually be the engineer. That's crazy. He's still in there though. What's the point? I have to run around for 10 minutes before anything happens. What's the point? Is that two tasks? Okay, type it again. Oh my gosh. Wow, finally I can now look at cameras. Oh my days, bro. Oh my god. Oh, it's Ethan. He's here. Wait, Ethan. You know what? Ethan Ethan's my guy. I You know what? I don't care. He's just venting everywhere. I actually rate that from him. It's hard cuz Wait, I actually just don't think Simon is an engineer. I actually think Simon might actually be a killer. hell. Still, it feels like 10 minutes. You got 10 minutes. 10 minutes between kills. What? Oh, all right. I guess Oh, right. No, it's not. Wait, no. No, no, wait. Wait, what? What? Bez, you were just with Lachlan. What? You just killed Lachlan in front of me. Yeah, because there's 45 seconds between kills. I'm Rattled. Rattled. Rattled. Rattled. Rattled. Rattled. I am rattled. 45 seconds. 45 seconds. Ethan. Ethan. Do you know what would have made the round easier for you? Not killing your imposter teammate in the first round. But I don't know that, do I? You stupid No gimme. It's a charity win. I love a bazinger. Well done, champs. 45 seconds. me. Love a bazinger. Toby, I just want you to know, bro, you can't do that to me. Spent three years. No. Be you are actually really rattled, right? That's crazy. We still don't care, mate. Yeah, it's kind of crazy. Bez rattled. All right, let's get back in there. I'm not salty. I'm not salty. I'm not salty. I'm Oh, now I'm going to be a blank crewmate. Ah, I want to be clear. I've had these cardboard cutouts cuz I was going to hit them when they killed me. I've not actually been killed by any of these people. I'm still waiting for it. I think I'd rather not be an imposter. I've been an imposter an awful lot. Just give me a nice clever crew mate role. Engineer, it's toxic. It's good. Finally. Okay. But I don't know who the other person is. Now, here's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking I kill Simon first. Even if he is another imposter, actually. No, that's mean. I won't do that. Here we go. There are three imposters among us. Sheriff. Oh, you know what? I have a good chance. I'm going to just go for JJ now. No. Wait. modify shy time this all right okay please I don't want to see no blue oh I can't honestly please so jarring if it's blue tracker I don't give a I don't care that all right what am I going to do just kill me off bro JJ I'm going to just follow JJ kill me bro honestly kill Okay. Okay. Yo, let's go. Let's go. Clear up. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no. Wait. Sorry, Simon. Toby. Toby is JJ's clear. No, Toby. Toby's not Toby killed me. Then time lord. It's all time lording. Yeah. Whatever you say. Whatever you say. How does Toby think that Deji killed Simon and Simon saying no? Wait. What did Simon say? You didn't die. I don't think. Did you? No. I did die. I did die. But then someone time lorded and it was Toby that killed me. Sure. Whatever you say. You know what? I'm happy to go for it. But you saying that you died, Simon. No, I did die. I think we skip. This is too vague. No. Shut up, Vic. What do you mean? I died. No, he's held on this one from the previous round, bro. And he's just waiting before. JJ's clear. That's all you need to know. Who killed you, Simon? Are you going to tell us? Uh, Toby. I think Locky's cleared, too. Let's go. Love that. Well, it could have been Harry or Locky that were clear. That's I don't know which one. It wasn't me. Medic. Yay. Who shall I shield? Hang out with all Locky laser. You know, have a gift. Hang out with this guy. Oh, I've been shielded. Okay, that means he's the medic. That's good to know. Hey Toby, enjoy being a ghost. Edi killed Simon. You look I saw him. Enjoy ghost life, I swear you didn't even die. Are you Oh my gosh. Are you serious? You didn't even die, did you? He killed. Such obvious bait, bro. It's such obvious. I did die. I died. All right. Dodge. Dodge. Dodge. Follow me. Okay. Oh, I'm dead again, bro. Ah, Tobyy's going to kill me. I'm going to kill Toby. I'm going to kill Toby. And that will make him innocent. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Oh, Toby, I'm just going to do it randomly. Five. Four. It's going to happen. It's going to happen. No. What? No. You protected him. Protected you, you bastard. No, no, no, no, no. So stupid. Okay, Harry or Locky are medics. I know that much. One of them shielded me. See if he shields me again. If I get shielded again, I know it's him. I'm going go in here. Otherwise, it was Harry. If I've accidentally cleared Locky while he's an imposter, that'd be crazy. I'm just going to shut the door now. Oh, Oh, well. Whoa. Whoa. Weird time war. The door's shut. Wild time warp. All right. Well, no one will remember. Oh, I vouched for you. I've been waiting to do that the entire recording. I was just waiting for one of them to kill. Um, okay. All right. Let's go back in the event event operations. There we go. Okay, pink's gone in there or there. Blue around there. Is this vent system great? I think it's one of the better ones. Ethan's gone up there. Jabz on his own. Oh, the bloody Can we stop with the time lord? Feels like I have to kill him now. I've been offering up the opportunity. Ethan and Josh cross over again. Ethan's killed Josh and jumped in event. Hold. Oh, he ran past me. I'm going to say it was on cam so people believe me. That's time lord done that. Time lord did that. That's all time lord's fault. It was time lord. I'm lost. I'm so lost. What's going on, bro? Don't know if I'm going to get away with that. Um what? Guys, guys, I can give you one. I can give you one. I watched Ethan kill Josh on cams. All right, we'll take that. We'll take that. There you go. There you go. It's Ethan. Deji killed Simon. Simon. Me and Ethan got to go, man. Guys, I've seen Deji kill Simon twice now. Trust me. Trust me. He'll get dead. Toby. Are you 100% sure? 100%. He killed Simon. Toby. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Toby. No. I believe you. I believe. I believe. I believe Toby. All right. It worked. The the the hyper strat worked. Should we Should we jump in the vent this time? This side. This time. Also, I can't die to the million imposters when I'm in a tent. So, it's actually quite safe. But how's Vick say on cams? I saw him. Like, I'm literally here on cams. Ah, he's going to kill me. Come here, you little You're dying today. off. You're dying today. Oh I missed I'm turn. I don't care how many times they time, Lord. Just Hey, hey, you ain't got turns like me, little bro. You ain't got turns like me, little bro. Come here. You're dying, Dej. JJ, JJ, JJ, JJ, vouch for me. JJ, vouch for me. JC, stay with me, bro. Bro, it's Toby. Twice. Do it. TJ. Yeah. Hey, Toby. Toby. How does it feel? Huh? How does it feel? You kill me twice and you do and you It's Wait, what? I can't believe you can't stop round. You can't be asked, man. Stop. Is it Is it Deji? It's dead. It's three rounds. You lot. Why? But why? Why is it dead? Well, I saw him kill. It's to recob. So I tried to kill Toby, but then I timed it. I time dilated it. You You went You rewind. I time lorded and I saw him kill. So And you damn DJ. You D. You idiot. It's Toby. You saw him kill me. You killed him. I Toby killed me twice. Now guys, convince me. Changed my mind. Toby is not an imposter. Changed my mind. He He slapped my neck twice, bro. JJ was there. He's being a and you're saying it's Toby. It's It was you. I saw you with my own two eyes. Why did you think it out for me? I just think I I just I just went see here's the thing, right? The imposters don't know who each other are. So, if two people have the same story, it's much more likely true in this case. votes. Toby, I seen Deji kill first round and second rounded twice. Oh my gosh. Are you being serious? It's time to see ghost ghost Okay, see you Enjoy ghost life You look Oh, I can't be asked, bro. Oh, these are so stupid. Oh, JJ is getting killed every single round. I don't care. I'm killing him every round. Oh my gosh. Do we 50/50 Toby for safety? Bro, everyone is so rattled. I suspect that we did. All right. Do we just How do they fix it real quick? Engineer engineer real quick. Oh my gosh. Do we 50/50 for safety? Surely. I I was thinking surely we get rid of one of these. 50/50 for safety. Yeah, but guys, I'm telling you, I've seen Deji kill twice. I'm telling you, dead ass now. I'm actually being dead ass. I know I was on his on his tail, but I'm being dead. So, what did you see? Go on. Split your case, bro. He killed him first round and second round and got saved by twice. I did I did see Did you kill Toby the second time? I don't know. Harry Bing, what's going on? If you want to be safe, you can vote me. If you want to be safe, you can vote me. I'm just telling you what I saw. So, who do you think the other imposter is, Toby? I don't know who the other imposter is. All I know is I saw Deji killed. I've been following him around. You have to give us a name. You have to give us a crew. No, no, no, he doesn't. He doesn't know. He does. He does. Going to vote him. How can I give if he if he doesn't know who it is, then how's he going to give it a name? We can make it one up. Simon said JJ was clear from the start. And Simon's dead. So, I think we have to we have to finish the 50/50 just just for dead. No, no, but I don't like how Vic is pushing that. But you know what? I can also actually J before I vote I do I like your Harry called the meeting though. Harry, I'm voting for Vic. I think you tell me who did you Harry? I skipped. All right, I'm going I'm going as well. Okay. What the What the I can't to myself. What the No, you guys are moving too much. Let's play the game. I thought I thought Vic was he was sketchy there. What the is happening? God, these are stupid, bro. Great. Now, great lobby. I'll never hear this from you. Deji rattle is big. Deji, how you rattled still? You've been trolled by your brother. Yeah, D. I'll never hear this from you, you know. No. Why? Why? You've been trolled by your brother and you're falling for it. You've thrown more games than anyone. Why am I catching strays out of nowhere? All right. this. I'm killing JJ cuz he's definitely the time guy. All right. Look very You know what? You're looking very scrumptious. I'm actually going to take you out. Yeah, I think I think is JJ just being weird. I don't know. The lights go. Oh, JJ Toby imposters. I don't know. Oh, the lights already gone. Oh, I've been protected. All right, everyone is here. Everyone is chilling. All right. Wait, did I just Oh my god. What the How do Oh, yes. Yes, I'm back. Wait, Toby kill me. Did Toby kill? Be ready to report a body ASAP. I'm going to frame JJ. There's most certainly one left cuz it would be will be beyond over. So, everyone's still here. So, it's one imposter. Wait, maybe if I kill in front of him. Oh my god. Oh my god. Jesus Christ. JJ. JJ, honestly, I'm going to make it my mission that you literally die every single round. Harry, why did you change your mind? JJ, could JJ convince me? No. Daddy, how did it feel being a ghost Hey JJ, you know at the start Yeah. I sheriff killed you and obviously you were innocent. So I died and then I got revived and then killed Toby. second round. Then you time warped and obviously I was out of shot so he just chased me down and killed me. That round was so funny. It's so funny cuz I literally do it in front of Deji and I'm like, "Yeah, got him. Got him. " JJ, why did you vote Deji? JJ, did you just do it to with him? No. So I thought Did you actually kill? No. Stop it, JJ. Didn't There's no way you thought that. Fine. Fine. I was trolling. I thought that I didn't think so. So, every time I saw someone die, I just rewind. How did you see it? Does it flash when someone dies? No, I just I I had a six sense. I'm literally every time I killed you time lorded. Okay, we're back. I had that one. I had that one in the bag. Like, finish the 50/50 and now I'm the time lord. So, we just try and bring someone back to life. All righty. I am the sheriff. This is actually such a huge role for this where there's three imposters. I can't get fragged. Give me a sheriff again, please. Oh no. Oh no. I don't know who's who. Yes. Yes. Where's dead again? I don't care. Toby, you're dying. I'm killing them. Please give me red, please. Yes. Ah, sweet. I don't care. I don't care. Broad daylight. I don't care. I do not care. I do not care. I do not care. I do not care. I do not care. No, he's following me. Betty wants to kill me. Going to be dead. Bet he wants to kill me. That son's a guy. What the Time lord now. Soon as the lights are fixed now. Oh my. Is he about to come back to life? About to come back to life. He's going to come back. I clicked I clicked it as the rewind happened. I don't think it had enough time for him to come back to live. He'll be alive, by the way. He'll be alive next week. He might do that. That was something happened. That same happens to mine, right? Yeah, he'll be alive next round. Okay, we'll see. We'll see. What did you see, Lannon, though? I I mean I know pretty much exactly who killed him. We can No, no, no, no. Yeah, let's just wait for the person. No, no, no, no, no, no. Why? Okay. No. Let's Before we vote, Before we vote, why don't we Why don't we just give the person who killed Toby the chance to redeem? Let's hear it from Toby. Yeah. No, no, not yet. No, no, no, no. Not from Toby. Let's just hear from the No. I'm saying I'm saying Tobyy's going to be alive after this. J saying Jay wants to kill her to own up to it now. Yeah, maybe if they if they own up, we can maybe let them off it. Then we'll we'll let you live. We'll let you live. Yeah, if you want to get a guilty go. A guilty plea. Come on then. Shock. It didn't work yet again. Hold on. I just smashed it, mate. I actually wouldn't have voted. I I I wouldn't have voted. I wouldn't have voted. I thought it would have been like a big aggressive play and I would have liked it cuz they can kill the imposters. Remember, imposters aren't all enemies. Imposters could kill imposters. All right. Well, I feel like that was valuable. Poor Toby. I hope he comes back. We'll see. Please bring me back. Please come. Resurrect him. Resurrect him. He might not be. Bring him back. Bring back the chisel. Please. Oh, you better not be back. I'm back. No. Are youing dumb? this game. No. Get out. Get time lord out, bro. Is Toby back? Oh, Tomy's back. Oh, he's back. Where is he? Where is he? I don't care. No, no, no. If I can a genuine piss take this. Oh, I might just go for a send here and then that way everyone sees it and someone will have the rewind. Oh my god. Okay. What? No, my rewind's not up. It was that. All right. It all happened so again. I was following Toby and I know I know who killed him. Okay. Okay. I'll just reveal the information I had from the previous round. Killed twice. Yeah. I'll just reveal the information I have from the previous round since Toby uh unfortunately, you know, came back kind of died again. Crazy. That's what happened. It was Deji. So, Deji also killer. I've seen kill Toby this time. So, Deji killed Toby. What now? Other killer killed Deji. Is that what you're saying? Laser. No, I just know Deji was a killer. I didn't know. I don't know what happened that second time. Deji kill. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The first round. Yeah. Make him a killer, right? Simon, what did you just say? It was either you or Lachlan have killed. It wasn't me. So, you know what, Simon? This This is like trust right here. I did kill Deji, but I'm not an imposter. No, Toby. If you killed Deji, then Vic killed Toby then. No, no, Deji killed Toby. Lannon just said that. No. No. I He killed this round. He would kill him again. Deji would kill him again. No, he didn't. Okay, Lachlan was on Deji. Yeah, I was. I'm confused. Sorry. That's what I was doing, I guess. Well, we know one of them's been got, so we could just skip, right, guys? Imposters. Yeah, we don't need to solve the, you know, crime of a murderer. Alice, it has to be fair, surely. No, no, we'll just Simon, you're good at the game. Simon, you don't you don't have doubt like that. You don't have doubt like that. So, I've literally I've seen Lachlan next to Deji, but you where was I then? Maybe sheriff killed him. Well, that's what Lachlan is literally saying. Lucky Vic sus, you're so lucky little You were going to die anyway. I was going to kill you and you were going to kill me. Simon's an idiot. Simon's the other one. Yeah. Now he's on his own. Wait, Simon killed you, right? Simon killed me. Okay. I got killed by uh Lachlan. By Lachlan? Yeah. Simon's done, bro. Weird. Weird. I don't know. Like, does he make mistakes like that? Okay. Well, I'm screwed. I have literally no way of winning this. I want to kill another pack kill and then if I die, they'll resurrect me and then they'll know that I'm No, you can still That doesn't save you. Who do I think it is? Maybe Vickar Vic might be on my case. I'm going to go in and just shoot him. Ready? Here we go. Don't do me in like that. Vickar, don't do me in. I don't want to have to throw your something at your cardboard cutout. Track him. I can fix movements at all times now. This is the shittest. Okay, so I killed myself. Rewind. Everyone. No. No. Right. I think he went for me. I'm confused by that. I think he just tried to sheriff kill me. I should have rewinded actually. I think he just Oh, so you're the Yes, I am. I don't think there's a guesser. Yeah. And I think And that's Look, as Locky said he would basically sheriff last time cuz he killed Dej and he's not imposter. That does make sense. You're saying he tried to sheriff kill you and it bounced back. Or you killed him. Yeah. Or you killed him. This could be the boldest kill. This could be the kill. Literally said last night, I don't make bold kills. I don't make bold kills. There was there was four of us in the room and he did just stab him right in front of us. So I mean no my suspicion is that that was his second sheriff kill. Okay. And and also and Harry and Harry was actually near him. Harry was actually near him and Harry didn't lunge. He just dropped on the spot. Like it wasn't as if someone had killed him. So Lachlan went for Harry. I was doing I was I was innocently doing my my class. We were we were either side of him. Lachlan basically said last round he was sheriff without saying it. I think he he went for one of us. But you said he's gone for you, but then you said he was near Harry. He was in between the two of us. Yeah, he was on top of us. He was on top of us. Yeah. Yeah, he was. And also ping. But anyway, um yeah, we're on seven. So I think it could be Ethan.

We're talking telepathically. See, Senor, now if you see someone killed and then you don't report it, you know, that's what we did. Yeah.

I'm going to be really annoying and press the emergency button. I don't know what's going on, but it, man. Let's make this more chaotic. Oh, look. I'm sure this will be valuable. Uh, I just wanted us to chat for a bit more. Shut up. But we we literally ran out of stuff to talk about last meeting. We didn't even vote anyone. Well, let's talk about the e economic climate. I want to hear what you got to say on it, man. Look, I'm not going to vote. With opinions, I'm over it, man. Let's move on. I'm I'm not voting, JJ. Talk. Let's Let's talk about tariffs.

Uh I I I guess to uh increase is a part of the economy. Oh yeah, good point. Um, we got 30 seconds. Um, do we have to use it though? Yes. Uh, we don't. We really don't. Ethan, let's I say we just skip and uh we we move on. Look, if anyone kills him right in front of me, free pass. That's all I'm saying. I am exercising my free will and I want to wait. I'm so sorry. This is my free will. This guy has a daughter, by the way. This guy has a daughter, by the way. He doesn't want to see his daughter. He wants to in a meeting. She's not here. She's away. He has no more meetings. We're fine. I sink further and further into despair every single time these meetings are called. Oh, I put the faith in thee. Oh, please protect me. O, if you are a bad man, kill Harry and I won't say a word. You can do it. It actually isn't though because it's not Bez, right? I know it's not me. The after party.

Not these clowns. I'm gone invisible. Oh, he's Is he gone invisible? Has he gone fully invisible or just partially invisible? Let's go and see. Oh, lights were out. He's gone partially invisible. We need to go and fix the lights, but it's a little bit risky. Also, enough time has passed. Okay. They're going to say they were together. Yeah. Oh, I just left. I have I have information, by the way. Well, I have just saved the game. Oh. Oh, you've saved you saved my mental state. That's for sure. Thanks, mate. I saw Josh vent. That's all. I don't He might be engineer, but I saw him come out the vent. Good guess. Well done. Okay, then Harry, what is this laughing going on? Simon, what did you do? Bro, I've run around looking for bodies. Well, as in as in if there is two imposters left, Yeah. then one more kill would have done it. All right. Well, I'm I'm pretty certain that me and Josh aren't killing anyone. I I think I I'm going to go on a limb here. I think it's Laser Beam. Unless it's Simon who's double marinated off actually. Simon, can I trust you? Please be honest here, mate. Have you Have you done it? Oh, that was an evil lie. Simon, would you lie to us? Like, you wouldn't lie to us, would you? No, I wouldn't lie to you. Promise. You probably wouldn't lie to us in this instance at least. Yeah, I promise. Doesn't sound like he promises, though. Like, do you mean I don't like that you two are just doing something here? Cuz this is this is very much like it could be you two. Are you sure? If I was to tell you if I was to tell you that we're doing nothing, would you believe us? Uh, yes. Like we are we are doing nothing. My my head my head tells me lazy. My heart tells me Simon. I'm Simon. I'm sorry, Simon. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Harry, bro, I thought you you had the evil laugh. I can't trust you. That's because you always do the same thing.

I got to recharge the energy, you know. Why didn't Lannon speak? Yeah, I don't know. That was a weird one from him. Was he muted? I don't know. or is he just giving up or something? Cuz it's very obvious. If he said any words, they would have voted Simon. Simon was going for me every round. I was like, Simon isn't wrong and he's going for me. Like, he has to be an imposter, right? So, what the am I meant to do here, by the way? Ah, I knew it. I knew it. Somebody find me. Help me. Where's Harry gone? I've done one time.

They've both been accused of is to be. Just pick Deji or Simon. Everyone pick one of the two. Everyone pick one of the two. This is just a It's just a It's a It's an RNG game. Why is Vic controlling this? I'm not listening to anyone. I'm voting for Deji anyway. Toby killed Gigi. Deji killed me. Get out of here, dog. Lannon has killed me. He's also He's so on this attack that it's definitely him. It's so trying to say Lannon killed him. This guy. Thank you. Thank you. How the is this happening? What the Wow. All right. I feel like L might have been telling the truth. I can feel it when he gets triggered. And when he gets triggered like that sometimes, he actually like is actually right. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to kill Simon for him. I swear to God, Simon isn't even good. He just somehow the rest of the side men, they just agree. I guess all the imposters voted for Lannon because I know he's clear. So, I should have actually paid attention to who they were. Just someone do the meltdown thing. Um, all the imposters just voted for Lannon. I'm barely I'm fairly sure votes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One apart from me cuz I'm not imposter. But I did vote. Yeah. Yeah. I I believe that Harry getting away with the leading retirees the leader last game. Listen to me. Listen. I'm listening. Me then vote Vic. Okay. All right. Cool. All right. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Sure. Because he's imposter. It was only me and you who ran to do um react. Everyone else stayed in the main room. I could have just got left it if I was imposter. I noticed that. That's what I'm saying. Vic is calling this out of nothing. I was just throwing it out there. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's fine. I just wanted to see you bikes. I wanted to see you bit. I wanted to see you bit. Get me then get still here. We got a contract, guys. We get Vic next round. No, no, no. Vick's gone. Well, Vic Vic might have a chance to defend. Yeah, I will defend myself.

I know. This is like such And I may have got Vic out, too. And if you Everyone saw the time war, dude. All right, we do. We need to get Deji. I think we need to get Deji. React to every day. Have we lost the I think Lannon was the time. No. Was he? I don't know. All right. You know what, Simon? I'm going to kill Vic for you. I actually don't think it's Vic, though, cuz Vic was doing the reactor with me the first time. But you know what? Oh, I could I could try. Why pop you on that side then? What would be the point in that? Well, we run. We run time. Reap. No. Why is Deji invisible? What? Look, he's he's going to kill me. Look. Yeah, he's going to kill me. Just do it. Kill me, D. Yeah, I just I can't be honest. I hate this game. I hate this game. And that is going to get away with it as well. Hang on a minute. What in the ass CL is going on? Right. Right. But Vic went Vic was down. I couldn't have killed someone. No. No. You were You were with Lachlan. You were with Lachlan. You killed it. You killed it. I didn't kill it. I didn't. Why you didn't go? No. No. Vic, I'll tell you why I didn't kill him. I was sat in the vent. I was sat in the vent beneath Zero who went and did the top of it. Oh. So, who killed him? It was you. It was It was one of yours. No, it was you. It was one of yours. It wasn't D. It wasn't me. I want to. I don't care. Was it was it was it you? Apparently, if you if you saw me, you would know it's not me, Toby. If we all skip, we can just go on to the next next me. No, I think it's Vic. I think I think it's Josh and Harry. I think it's Josh and Harry. No, no, no. Well, it's not me and it's I don't think it's Josh, so I'm voting you. Victor, I love you, man. But shut the up. You're not cooking right now. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Harry, what did you see, bro? I tell you what. I went into um reactor and I saw Vic. I was with Vic and Locky. Okay. They went they went to do the bottom one and I thought I'd be funny. So I I went to the top one but instead of doing that I'm an engineer. So I just sat in the vent and went and then I saw Josh come and do the top one and so it must have been Victor that killed him at the bottom. So Vic, what did you I walked out after doing the bottom one and then the body was reported and he stayed down there. So it's these. So it's Harry and Josh. It's Harry and Josh. No, it's No, it's just Harry will vote for me any opportunity and he's not voting for me right now. It's because you're both imposters. So, I should skip, right? No, no, go there. We lose either way. We lose either way because there's three uh there's three imposters. I voted. Okay. Well, I'll vote Josh because I think he's one of them. But yeah. Um and Sick next round. everyone. You're all stupid. My team lobby of all time. Let's go. Do we win? Let's go. Hang on. saying it was Harry and Josh. You literally killed me. Ethan, three wins in a row, guys. I was time lord. Yeah.
